# Invisible Conway's Game of Life
This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, with no input or output.

# Inspiration
William Stalling states in *Operating Systems: Internals and Design Principles* that "typically, \[computer applications\] accept input from the outside world, perform some processing, and generate output." I wanted to create an application that defies these norms, and the Game of Life felt appropriate for such an application.
